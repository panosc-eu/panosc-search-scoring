Introduction
============

This documents list all the endpoints available through the Scoring API. The endpoints are organized in sections grouping endpoints pertaining to the same type object or actions.

Please refer to the document PaNOSC Federated Search Results Scoring document for more detailed description of the theory behind the Scoring service and for the definitions of key concepts.

Items 
======

Items are the scoring PaNOSC datasets and documents that are going to be used in the weight computation and, later on, for the scoring. We decided to call them **_items_**, instead of using the most common term **_documents_**, because in the PaNOSC project the word document is a specific type of entity which is a subset of all the possible entities that we can possibly perform the scoring on.

Model
-----

The item model has the following fields:

* _id  
_id/pid of the item provided by catalogue system
* _group  
_string defining the group this item belongs to. Example: datasets or documents. Default: _default._
* _fields  
_scoring information. It can contain a string or a complex nested json object. It is named fields as in most cases is a set of relevant fields extracted from catalogue system. The minimum set of scoring information suggested are the fields returned by the PaNOSC federated search.

Endpoints
---------

### GET /items

Returns the complete list of items saved in the database  
Parameters:
  - limit: number of items returned. Default: \(int\) 1000
  - offset: number of items to remove before extracting the number of elements requested with _limit_. Default: \(int\) 0

Weights computation
===================

The weights computation status is saved in the database and updated according to the user requests and also by the background processes.

Model
-----

The weights computation model contains the following fields:

* _id_  
UUID assigned by the system when a new weights compute request has been received
* _requested_  
timestamp when the weight computation request was last received. It is empty only if the system has not received any weight computation request since it was initialized.
* _started_  
timestamp when the background process has started the weights computation. It is empty if a new request has come in and the background process has not been spawn yet.
* ended  
timestamp when the background process has completed the weights computation. It is empty if a new request has been received and not served yet, or the computation is on\-going.
* progressPercent  
Progress in percent of the weights computation procedure. 0% means that the request has been received but not served yet. It is 100% when the computation has been completed and the old weights have been deleted from the database.
* progressDescription  
current action performed during the computation procedure. Used mostly during debugging and system, setup.
* inProgress  
boolean field indicating if a weight computation process is active. This fields indicates that the weights are being updated and might not be consistent.

Weights management
==================

Weights endpoint only provides a way to retrieve the list of all weights or by group or the count. Weights cannot be modified from these endpoints.

Model
-----

Weights are the output of the weight computation process. They are save individually in the database according to the following model:

* _id: \(str\)  
_UUID automatically assigned by the weights computation process
* _term: \(str\)  
_Term extracted from the scoring information of one or more items.
* _ItemId: \(str\)  
_UUID of the item where this terms appears with the associated weight
* _itemGroup: \(str\)\[optional\]   
_Group of the item where this term has been extracted from. It is duplicated to facilitate querying. Default: _default_
* _timestamp: \(datetime\)  
_Timestamp when this weight has been computed.
* _value: \(float\)  
_Value of the weight associated with the pair \(item,term\)

Endpoints
---------

### GET /weights

Return all the weights stored in the service related to one of the groups. 

Parameters:
* group: \(str\)\[optional\]

Returns:
* Status code: 200
* list of weights. Each weight will follow the model above.

### GET /weights/count

Returns the total number of non\-zero weights present in the database.

Parameters:
* group: \(str\)\[optional\]

Returns:
* Status code: 200
* number of weights with the following structure:
```
{
  count: (int)
}
```


Terms management
================

Model
-----

No database model is associated with terms. Terms are derived from the weights models.

Endpoints
---------

### GET /terms

Returns the list of terms extracted from all the items.  
Parameters
* Group: \(str\)\[optional\] Specify the group we would like to retrieve terms from.

Output:
* List of terms with the following structure:
```
{
 term           : (str)
 numberOfIterms : (int) number of items where the terms is found
 numberOfGroups : (int) number of groups where this terms is found
}
```


Score computation
=================

Model
-----

No database model is associated with scores. They are computed using weights but they are persistent in the database.

Endpoints
---------

### POST /score

Parameters:
* _query \(str\)_  
sentence or list of key words to use in the relevancy scoring

list of items id that needs to be scored in this request. Usually this list is provided by the catalogue system based on the hard filters provided. If no item ids are provided, all the items present in the database will be scored. Default: none.
* _group: \(str\)\[optional\]_   
group of items to be scored. If not provided, all type of items from all groups will be scored. If provided, only the items of the selected group will be scored. If items list is provided, it will be filtered according to the specified group. Default: none
* _limit: \(int\)\[optional\]_  
number of item to return after the scoring has been done and items have been sorted according to scores. All the scored items will be returned if not provided or it has a negative value. Default: _\-1_
